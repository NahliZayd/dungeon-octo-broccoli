# dungeon-octo-broccoli
Dungeon crawler project 
This is my attempt to create a dungeon crawler.
The goal is to learn how to use Swing, but also various algorithms in order to randomly generate dungeons etc..
For the moment the game contains only a rather thin base that I will enrich every month.

To do : 
- [X] Make a fps counter 
- [X] Create player 
- [X] Create listener for movements 
- [ ] Make the different menus (pause menu, home menu, hud in game)
- [ ] Create the different entities
- [ ] Create the items
- [ ] Add skills for the players 
- [ ] Generate dungeons 
- [ ] Create textures 
- [ ] Add various algorithms for dungeon generation
- [ ] Add fps mode

My code is under MIT so feel free to use this code without crediting me
